Expense Tracker Project

The project consists of 3 python modules in the Expense Tracker Folder (app, model, dialogs)

The basic functionality is to create an expense tracker application with a GUI, which can:
  1. Add/Remove expenses
  3. Implement data persistence
  4. Display expenses
  5. Filter displayed expenses by column, and sort expenses by category
  6. Display the total of all expenses and the total of select categories
  7. Export data to file
  8. Visualize spending (Current version only implements a pie chart)

The project is ongoing and has some support/methods for additional features not yet implemented (e.g: graph spending by category over time).
